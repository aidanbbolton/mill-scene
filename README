/*
*  Final Project
*
*  This program creates a scene consisting of rivers, a pond, and a mill with a water
*  wheel. There are trees bordering the scene and the reflection of the scene can be seen
*  in the water. This is drawn utilizing the stencil buffer.The pond and river depth are 
*  set by specifying a set of points to apply as a modifier to the y values of the board. 
*  A skybox is drawn around the scene when it is in first person mode. An orbiting light 
*  provides the scene with definition and lighting. Most objects are drawn using a simple
*  triangle function with transformations applied, which can be seen by pressing "c". The 
*  inputs allow the user to specify the size and orientation, as well as texture and 
*  texture scale. A few features I had to cut due to lack of time were the windows and 
*  better first person navigation, along with more dynamic lighting. 

	The skybox texture was downloaded from 
	https://www.deviantart.com/raywindly-kingdom/art/Nightsky-335823134
	
	All code except for the inbuilt helper functions were written by me. I spent at least 
	20 hours working on this.
